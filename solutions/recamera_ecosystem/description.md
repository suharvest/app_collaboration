## What This Solution Does

reCamera can do a lot on its own — but its real power comes from connecting it to the platforms you already use. This solution provides ready-to-use integrations that bring reCamera's AI detection and live video into different ecosystems: view a heatmap directly in your browser, add it to Home Assistant, or connect to other platforms as they become available.

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Pick Your Platform | Choose the integration that fits your workflow — Home Assistant, standalone preview, or more coming soon |
| One Camera, Multiple Uses | The same reCamera can serve heatmap data, smart home automation, and more simultaneously |
| Quick Setup | Each integration is a one-click deployment — no coding, no manual configuration |
| Privacy by Default | AI processing stays on the camera; only the data each platform needs gets sent |

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How to Use |
|----------|------------|
| Quick Demo | Deploy the heatmap preview to show clients what reCamera can do — no extra hardware needed |
| Smart Home | Add reCamera to Home Assistant for live video + AI-triggered automations |
| Multi-Platform Setup | Use heatmap preview for analytics AND Home Assistant for automations — both from the same camera |
| Platform Evaluation | Try different integrations to find the best fit before committing to a platform |
