### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Deployment fails with port conflict | Port 8086 or 3000 in use | Close the program using the port, or change the port in configuration |
| Docker won't start | Docker Desktop not running | Open the Docker Desktop application |
| Container stops after starting | Insufficient memory | Ensure at least 4GB RAM available |
