## What This Solution Does

Rearranging shelves and moving promotions around based on gut feeling rarely works well. This solution uses AI cameras to track customer movement and generate intuitive traffic distribution maps, showing you which areas are hot spots and which are dead zones — so you can make data-driven decisions for store operations.

And you don't have to stress about device selection — reCamera works out of the box for single-camera setups, while IP cameras + AI boxes can handle more channels. The same algorithm runs on different hardware with consistent results, so you can try before you commit.
