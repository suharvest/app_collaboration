## What This Solution Does

Rearranging shelves and moving promotions around based on gut feeling rarely works well. This solution uses an AI camera to track customer movement and generate intuitive traffic distribution maps, showing you which areas are hot spots and which are dead zones - so you can make data-driven decisions for store operations.

## Key Benefits

|---------|---------|
| Find Hot Spots | See at a glance which shelves attract the most customers - no need to review hours of footage |
| Discover Dead Zones | Instantly identify which aisles get ignored and which corners are overlooked |
| Compare Time Periods | Morning vs evening, weekdays vs weekends - pull up historical data anytime |
| Automatic Privacy Protection | People are processed on-camera before transmission - only location data is sent, no faces |
