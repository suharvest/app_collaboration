## What This Solution Does

Running a store means wondering what customers really want — What questions are they asking? Are staff responding properly? Which products get asked about most? This solution places a small device in your store to automatically capture staff-customer conversations, helping you understand what's happening on the floor every day.

## Core Benefits
