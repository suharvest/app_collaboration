## Core Features

- **Edge-based Voice-to-Text** - SenseCraft Voice runs directly on in-store edge devices, processing voice activity detection and speech recognition locally. All audio is processed at the edge, greatly reducing cloud dependency and enabling real-time transcription.

- **Far-field Retail-Ready Audio Capture** - Designed for far-field audio capture in noisy retail environments. Supports microphone arrays, beamforming, and noise suppression to focus on real customer-employee conversations even with background music and ambient chatter.

- **Privacy-First Edge Architecture** - Since audio is transcribed locally on edge devices, only text and metadata are sent upstream. Retailers maintain better control over privacy and compliance risks while keeping cloud costs and network requirements low.

- **From Conversations to Data-Driven Decisions** - Transcripts generated by SenseCraft Voice become structured, analyzable data. Retailers can measure service quality, identify common issues and pain points, and continuously improve scripts, policies, and overall store experience.
