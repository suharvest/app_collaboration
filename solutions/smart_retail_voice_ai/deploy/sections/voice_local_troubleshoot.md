### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Docker not running | Start the Docker Desktop application |
| Port 8090 is occupied | Close the program using that port, or modify the configuration to use a different port |
| Microphone device not found | Unplug and replug USB, verify it appears in Device Manager |
| Container startup failed | Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>` |
