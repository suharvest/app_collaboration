## What This Solution Does

The problem: warehouse workers are constantly running back to the computer - whether carrying goods, wearing gloves, or driving forklifts. Every inventory check or shipment record means stopping work and walking to a terminal.

This solution lets you operate your warehouse system by voice. Say "stock in 10 Watchers" and the system records it instantly, with data syncing in real-time.

## Core Value

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Hands-Free | Operate while wearing gloves, driving forklifts, or moving goods - no more running to computers |
| Real-Time Sync | Data updates the moment you speak - no more paper notes to enter later |
| Works With Your System | Connects to your existing WMS, ERP, or other systems - no need to switch |
| Flexible Deployment | Three options: cloud for quick start, private for data control, or fully offline |

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Forklift Operations | Driver asks "How many items on shelf A3?" - gets voice response without leaving the seat |
| Receiving Goods | Say "Stock in 5 Watchers" - system logs it automatically as you set down the goods |
| Order Picking | Say "Ship 3 units to ABC Company" - generates the shipping record |
| Daily Summary | Ask "What came in today?" - get a voice summary of the day's activity |
