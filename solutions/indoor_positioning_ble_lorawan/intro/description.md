## Problem

Indoor positioning is needed everywhere, but UWB solutions are expensive and complex to deploy.

## Solution

Low-cost indoor positioning with BLE beacons + LoRaWAN long-range transmission:

- **Campus Safety** - Wearable trackers with one-button SOS alerts
- **Asset Tracking** - Protect valuables, alert on unauthorized movement
- **Auto Attendance** - Automatic check-in when entering zones

## Two Positioning Modes

| Mode | Accuracy | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Triangulation | Meter-level | Movement tracking |
| Proximity | Zone-level | Check-in, presence |
