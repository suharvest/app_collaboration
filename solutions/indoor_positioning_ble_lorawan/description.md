## What This Solution Does

Where did that forklift go? Is the equipment still in the warehouse? Are workers at their stations? Traditional solutions are either expensive or require complex wiring. This solution uses battery-powered positioning tags and long-range wireless transmission to show you real-time locations of people and assets on your computer or phone.

## What You Need to Know

**Required Hardware**:
- Tracker (T1000): Card-sized device with lanyard, worn by people or attached to assets
- Positioning tags (BC01): Stick on walls as reference points, more tags = better accuracy
- Gateway (M2): Place centrally, receives tracker signals and uploads data
- Computer: Runs the positioning software, any office PC works

**Two Positioning Modes**:
- Precise (1-3 meters): Place 3+ positioning tags per zone, shows movement on map
- Zone-level: Place 1 tag per room, shows "which room" only

**Installation Tips**:
- Mount positioning tags at 2.5-3 meter height
- Space tags 10-15 meters apart
- Add extra tags in areas with metal shelving
