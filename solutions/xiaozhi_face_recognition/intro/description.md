## Problem Statement

Xiaozhi AI assistant cannot see faces and doesn't know who is speaking.

## Solution Value

Give Xiaozhi "eyes" to recognize your family and friends:

- **Face-based Greetings** - Automatically greet family members: "Welcome home, Mike"
- **Voice Enrollment** - Simply say "Remember my face, my name is Mike" to enroll
- **Local Storage** - Face data stored on device, never uploaded to cloud
- **Up to 20 People** - Perfect for homes and small offices

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Home | Auto-greet family members at door |
| Office | Employee check-in/attendance |
| Retail | VIP customer recognition |
| Elder Care | Identify caregivers |

## Voice Commands

**Enroll Face** (name required):
