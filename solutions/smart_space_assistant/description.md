## What This Solution Does

Your AI assistant is smart, but it can't "see" — it doesn't know who's talking to it.

Imagine this: You come home from work, and your AI assistant recognizes your face and says "Welcome back, John! You have 3 important emails today." When guests arrive, it can tell the difference between family and strangers. In a showroom, it recognizes VIP customers and provides personalized service.

This solution gives your AI assistant "eyes" and a "big screen," turning it into a true smart space butler.
